# Atto-C-Compiler
This repository contains source files for a compiler written in C. 
The purpose of this compiler is to parse and compile a subset of the C language referred to as "Atto-C" in this project.
This was a single-person final project for a 500-level course I took in college.
A description of the purpose for each file can be found on the top of each file.
