# Atto-C-Compiler
This repository contains source files for a compiler written in the C language. 
The purpose of this compiler is to parse and compile a subset of the C language referred to as "Atto-C".
This was a single-person, Capstone project for a 500-level college course.
A description of the functionality and role of each source file can be found on the top of each file.
